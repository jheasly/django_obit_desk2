Django Obit
===========

This Django app is in major flux, but its aim is allow area funeral homes 
to supply a given local newspaper with clean, reliable death notice and 
obituary information that can be quickly and easily formatted and distributed 
both online and in print. A few Adobe InDesign templates are included as 
examples.

Add this to your urls.py:
(r'^add/(?P<model_name>\w+)/$', 'obituary.views.add_new_model'),

Make sure you can send out an e-mail. (Elsewise, it'll bust on save().)

Also, add recipients to obituary_settings.py, otherwise no e-mails will go out.
