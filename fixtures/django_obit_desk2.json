She was the youngest of 12 children.\r\nAt age 11 months Lorraine\u2019s family moved from North Dakota to Colfax, Washington. In 1925 when she was 4 years old, her family came to Springfield, which at that time consisted only of a few blocks from Mill to 10th Street and from Main to C Street.  Everything outside of this boundary was country.  There were floods every winter until the dams were built.\r\nLorraine watched Springfield change from bean, hop and hay fields, walnut, filbert, peach and apple orchards and berry patches into freeways, shopping centers and housing developments.  Those were the days teenagers would go out and work in the fields and orchards to earn money for school clothes for the coming year.  Swimming in the river kept us out of trouble and we had loads of fun.  Great times.\r\nShe attended Springfield schools starting as a first grader the year Brattian School opened in 1927.  Lorraine attended middle school at the old Lincoln Jr. High school which stood where the present high school now sits.  She was in the last graduating class that graduated from the old high school which is now the administration building in 1939.\r\nLorraine married William Prociw in 1938 in Vancouver, WA.  He passed away in 1955 in a logging accident.\r\nShe worked at Agr-Pac, her sister\u2019s restaurant, several insurance agencies and retired in 1985 from Oregon Medical Laboratory which is now Peace Health Labs.\r\nLorraine loved to travel and upon retiring traveled on three cruises, three trips to Hawaii and visited Graceland and Washington D.C.  She also took many short trips with the senior center. Lorraine loved to golf, read, embroider, work in her yard, watch Atlanta Braves baseball games and was a long time Elvis fan.  She loved to spend time with family, including her church family of New Life at Wayside of which she was a member of.\r\nShe was also preceded in death by her parents, eleven siblings, a daughter Nancy Ann, grandson Kevin and numerous nieces and nephews.\r\nShe is survived by two sons, Dennis Eugene and wife Nancy and William Darrell and wife Lynda; two grandsons, Jeff and wife Leona, and Nick and wife Christina; three step-grandsons, Michael, Ronnie and Cory ; six great-grandchildren and 1 step-great-grandson.   \r\nIn lieu of flowers, please give in memory to New Life at Wayside, Lane County Youth for Christ or to your favorite charity.\r\nArrangements entrusted to Springfield Memorial Funeral Home.\r\n"

      "obituary_body": "Willard Lucas was truly a man of the river. Born and raised on the rugged Rogue River in Southern Oregon he claimed to have built his first boat at the age of three. He was an experienced river guide in his teens and went on to proficiency on many well known white water streams. He ran the Rogue, Illinois, Oyhee, and McKenzie in Oregon and the Middle Fork of Salmon River of Idaho numerous times. When not running rivers Willard honed his skills as a boat builder and many of his \"McKenzie River\" Dories are still out on the water even though the last one was built in 1976. In 1976 Willard and his wife, Maryanne took over management of the Lucas Pioneer Ranch and Lodge at Agness, upon the death of his father Larry Lucas. There they provided unique hospitality to river travelers until retirement in 1998. Willard truly loved the Wild Rogue Country that had been the center of his life since infancy. It was always on his mind as he retired to Eugene due to health reasons. Willard followed his beloved wife, his high-school sweetheart, in death late Thursday, January 31st. Maryanne had gone ahead of him to be with the Lord in April of last year. \r\nWillard was born Feb. 28, 1927. After his growing up years in Agness, he attended Myrtle Point High School until enlisting in the Navy in May of 1945, eventually serving on the Island of Guam, until being discharged in July 1946. A semester at the University of Oregon convinced Willard that \"studies\" were not his thing. He would eventually spend time working in local mills and even a stint as a Eugene Patrol Officer. But the river kept calling him and thus he spent most of his working years on the water or in his boat shop, or serving traveler's on the river. \r\nWillard is survived by his children; Melinda Mross & Gene of Eugene, Larry Lucas & Echo of Eugene, Nancy Tullius & Gregg of Salem, & Patrick Lucas & Patricia of Beijing, China. His grandchildren; Joseph Mross of Eugene, Laurie Cox of Eugene, Bethany Cole of Los Angeles, Michelle Provost of Atlanta, Tiffany Lucas of Fallbrook, CA., Chrystal Plum of Jefferson, OR., Cielle Lucas of Seattle, Kyrie Lucas of Beijing, Alaia Lucas of Beijing, Saret Lucas of Beijing, and by great-grandchildren; Andrew Mross of Eugene, Gabriel Evans of Fallbrook, Joshua Miller of Jefferson, OR., & Adrian Cole of Los Angeles. Willard is also survived by three sisers; Corlyss McCullough of Walterville, Donna Bosman of Eagle Point and Larryan Gerondale of Elizabeth, Colorado. \r\nA private celebration of life will be held February 10th. A public service is scheduled for July 20, 2013 Gold Beach, Oregon. Go to www.lucaslodgeoregon.com for more information. \r\nDad you have now crossed over your biggest, most powerful river. We all know how much you wanted to see Mom again. We will miss you, but will look forward to seeing you both again on the other shore. \r\nArrangements entrusted to Musgrove Family Mortuary.\r\nPlease sign guest book at musgroves.com."

      "obituary_body": "Virginia Geraldine Schmidt (n\u00e9e Ebner) peacefully departed this world on Sunday, January 13, at her home in Springfield, Oregon.  Virginia\u2019s last moments, in her home of more than 50 years and literally surrounded by some 40 family members, beautifully crystallize all that Virginia gave to this world, all that was most important to her and all that she meant to so many.  In her long and happy life, Virginia provided all who knew her an unequaled example of unconditional love, near-endless patience, and a quiet but fierce commitment to pure kindness. It is difficult to picture Virginia not smiling.\r\n\r\nVirginia was born October 26, 1932, to Albert and Angela Ebner in Mount Angel, Oregon.  After graduating from Mount Angel Academy and receiving her nursing degree from Sacred Heart School of Nursing, Virginia married her life-long love and dearest friend, Lawrence (Larry) Ralph Schmidt, on July 25, 1953.  Larry and Virginia\u2019s openness and warmth complemented one another beautifully.  Their 60th wedding anniversary will be celebrated this summer.\r\n\r\nVirginia\u2019s greatest joy and greatest creations were her eight children.  Virginia defined the love of a mother.  Her children reflect and bear witness to Virginia and her good works every day.\r\n\r\nVirginia was an accomplished seamstress, quilter and knitter, lovingly creating clothes, blankets, dolls, stuffed animals and heirloom quilts for her children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren.  She enjoyed family campouts, baking and opening her home to family and friends.  Her baked beans were without equal and will be dearly missed.\r\n\r\nVirginia\u2019s concern and care for others extended to her professional and community pursuits as well.  Virginia worked as a nurse at Sacred Heart Hospital in Eugene until she and Larry started their family.  After raising her eight children, Virginia returned to nursing, working at McKenzie Willamette and then Springfield High School, where she was the school nurse for 15 years.  As an active member of St. Alice Church for 58 years, Virginia served as a Eucharistic Minister taking communion to the sick and elderly, volunteered to chauffeur cancer patients to their treatments and was involved in numerous other parish activities.\r\n\r\nVirginia is survived by her beloved husband, Larry, 8 children, 21 grandchildren and 5 great-grandchildren. Her children are Marian Boileau (Michel), David (Alexis Schmidt), Catherine Krauss (Ron), Rita Proulx (Richard), Jane Schmidt (Scott Campbell), Ruth Watkins (Chris), Joseph (Michelle Schmidt) and Teresa Schmidt (Kelly Hovland), all of whom love her and miss her dearly.  Virginia was preceded in death by her parents, her brothers James Ebner and Jerome Ebner and her beloved grandson Justin Schmidt.\r\n\r\nA celebration of Virginia\u2019s life will be held this Saturday, January 19th, at 12:30 p.m., at St. Alice Church in Springfield. In lieu of flowers, Virginia\u2019s family requests that donations be made to Alzheimer\u2019s Association.\r\n"

She was a caregiver in Lane County for several years and then became a \"Nanny\" to different families until her retirement in 2002. \r\nMother was a kind, gentle person who loved God, and cared deeply for her family and friends. She touched the hearts of all who came into contact with her. She loved pinochle, baseball, a good cold beer now and then and hamburgers. She loved gardening, music, dancing and being with her family. Her smile and laughter was the gift she gave to all around her.\r\nShe is survived by three children; Peggy (Vern) Wittenberg of Springfield, Steve (Jane) Peterson of Marcola, and Stephanie Maki of Lebanon. Her son, Lanny preceeded her in death. She has 7 grandchildren and 6 great-grandchildren. \r\nThe ache in our hearts is profound. We will miss you in our lives more than words can say. We love you.

      "obituary_body": "Mayme Elizabeth Jones of Eugene, Oregon, passed away on January 9, 2013, where she was surrounded by her loving family.\r\n\r\nMom wanted to be remembered as a loving mom and grandmother.\r\n\r\nMayme was born at home to Virgil and Alice Princehouse on June 2, 1933.  She had two younger brothers, Frank and David Princehouse, who looked up to her in all things big and small.\r\n\r\nShe married the love of her life, Robert Longson Jones Sr on March 27, 1955 in Parkdale Oregon.  She and Bob spent most of their married life residing in Leaburg Oregon.  Mayme is survived by her 4 children; son Bob Jones Jr (Jerri), daughter Robyn Hlavac, son Micheal Jones (Debbie), and daughter Julie Davis (David).  She had 7 grandchildren; Nicole, Nate, Tyler, Robby, Zach, Tucker and Elizabeth; and one great granddaughter Madilyn.\r\n\r\nShe was preceded in death by her parents Virgil and Alice, her loving husband Bob, her brother Frank and her grandson Nate.\r\n\r\nShe kept her home immaculate, the cupboards and pantry were always stocked in a way that resembled the local food bank. There were no strangers to Mayme, she could strike up a conversation with anyone and was never afraid to \u201ctell it like it was\u201d. She could go anywhere, whether it was the local store or across country, and find someone she \u201cknew\u201d.  Her favorite pastime was shopping \u2026 coats and handbags were at the top of her list.  \r\n\r\nMom loved to cook for her family but couldn\u2019t get the quantity part down.  She always made enough for a small army and everyone would go home with a \u201ccare package.\u201d  Her favorite dessert to make was vanilla cake with \u201c7 minute frosting\u201d topped with coconut.  It will surely be missed.\r\n\r\nMom will be reunited with Daddy on March 27, 2013, their 58th wedding anniversary with a graveside service to be held at Idlewilde Cemetery in Hood River Oregon.\r\nRemembrances can be made in Mayme\u2019s name to the American Heart Association, PO Box 742030 Los Angeles CA 90074-2030 or Holt International Children\u2019s Services, PO Box 2880 Eugene OR 97402.\r\n \r\n"

      "obituary_body": "Judith Ann Mills\r\nNovember 17, 1939 \u2013 January 5, 2013\r\n\r\nJudith was born in McHenry, Illinois to Elmer & Helen Louise Montgomery.  She lived in California and Washington State during her childhood. Judy graduated from Bellevue High School in 1957. She attended Pacific University in Forest Grove, Oregon. At Pacific, she was in Kappa Delta sorority and was a member of the service club, the Boxerettes. In 1962 she completed her BA degree in Elementary Ed. at University of Oregon. Her first job as a teacher was at Pleasant Hill Elementary where she taught for two years.  In July 1963 Judy married Elvin Mills in Eugene, Oregon.  Judy was a stay-at-home mom and returned to teaching as a substitute. In the mid-70\u2019s she developed the kindergarten program at St. Mary School (O\u2019Hara Catholic School) in Eugene. In 1976 Judy started teaching at Laurel Elementary in Junction City, retiring in 2000. Judy and Elvin moved to Salem, Oregon several years ago.\r\n\r\nDistinctions and volunteer activities included selection for the Kyotaru Fellowship in Japan to study kites;  Friends of the Junction City Public Library board; member of the educator\u2019s society, Delta Kappa Gamma; member of the Junction City Education Together Foundation; and Habitat for Humanity. Judy was an active member of her local Catholic churches, including St. Mark and St. Paul in Eugene, St. Helen in Junction City, and Queen of Peace in Salem. Judy was an avid learner. She took classes of all kinds throughout her life. She was devoted to constantly improving the learning experience for each of her students and enriching her children\u2019s lives. Judy and Elvin\u2019s travels often centered on learning: trips to the mid-west to learn about her family history and meet family and their many trips with Elder Hostel. She enjoyed sewing, calligraphy, quilting, embroidery, and collecting Snoopy items. She was a fan of children\u2019s books illustrators and jigsaw puzzles. Her home was always decorated with her handiwork and that of others- anything she considered comforting, lovely, or fun. Judy loved the sound of the ocean waves; the memory of her cherished grandmother, Helen Stevens; chocolate; the satisfaction of creating things with her own hands; and her husband, children, and grandchildren.\r\n\r\nJudy is survived by her husband, Elvin; her brother Richard Glee Montgomery of Gig Harbor, Washington; her sister Virginia Gay Moi Moi of Ferndale, Washington; her son, Blake Mills of Hillsboro, Oregon; daughters, Kelly Mills and Ramona Murtha, both of Salem, Oregon; five beloved grandchildren: Nicole, Sofia, Lydia, Teyah, and Santiago; twelve brothers- and sisters- in-law; and many nieces and nephews. Remembrances may be made to Catholic Community Services: PO Box 20400, Salem OR 97307 and to the Nature Conservancy: www.nature.org.\r\n"

      "obituary_body": "Milton Rudy Powell was born in Richton, Mississippi to Clyde and Ora Mae Powell, on November 1, 1939. \"Rudy,\" as he was known to most friends, passed away at home with his family on December 27, after waging a long, spirited battle with bone-marrow cancer.\r\nIn the late 1940's Rudy moved to Oregon with his parents and older brother, Reginald, settling in Yoncalla where the boys helped with their father's farming and logging pursuits. In 1957 Rudy graduated from Yoncalla High School and a few years later married the girl next door, Opal Crow. Rudy and Opal shared a happy, lasting bond, celebrating their fifty-second anniversary this past summer. \r\nRudy and Opal moved to the Eugene area in 1961 where he attended the University of Oregon, graduating in 1965 and becoming a life-long Duck fan. While living in Eugene their two daughters, Kimberly and Kelly were born.\r\nAfter college Rudy worked fifteen years for Texaco, Inc. as an area representative. During that time he formed strong friendships and connections that helped guide him as he later developed his entrepreneurial  interests, becoming self-employed in 1980, eventually owning several stations and mini-markets.\r\nRudy loved country living and the family relocated to the Crow/Veneta area in 1970 where they lived until 1998. Rudy, a truly self-motivated, energetic man, took care of various interests while beginning his own business, Powell and Associates, doing land clearing, road building, selective logging, and property development. He and his long-time partner and friend started Allsup-Powell and developed several subdivisions and other projects. For Rudy, work was play and he greeted each new day with enthusiasm. He loved cars and equipment and felt a man should never be without a pickup or a tractor. He very much enjoyed his gold mine property in the Bohemia area. He made many good, new friends with each new pursuit.\r\n\tRudy had an active life made especially rich by four wonderful grandchildren. Rudy and Opal traveled and vacationed often, but time at home with his family was always most valued.\r\n\tRudy was preceded in death by his best friend and companion, his brother, \u201cReggie.\u201d He is survived by his wife, Opal, his daughters, Kelly Powell of Eugene, and Kimberly Gosser and son-in-law, Tim Gosser of Yakima, Washington, and grandchildren, Matt Gosser of Cheney, Washington, Carlie Ballinger and husband, Charlie Ballinger of Fort Belvoir, Virginia, and Katelyn Emmons and Kendyl Gosser of Yakima.\r\nA service is scheduled for 11:00am on January 2, 2013 at Springfield Memorial Funeral Home. The family wishes to thank the Willamette Valley Cancer Institute for their thoughtful care during Rudy\u2019s seven year battle with Multiple Myeloma, and Cascade Hospice for their valuable support. In lieu of flowers the family requests donations to the American Cancer Society.\r\n"
