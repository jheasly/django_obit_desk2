      "obituary_body": "Milton Rudy Powell was born in Richton, Mississippi to Clyde and Ora Mae Powell, on November 1, 1939. \"Rudy,\" as he was known to most friends, passed away at home with his family on December 27, after waging a long, spirited battle with bone-marrow cancer.\r\nIn the late 1940's Rudy moved to Oregon with his parents and older brother, Reginald, settling in Yoncalla where the boys helped with their father's farming and logging pursuits. In 1957 Rudy graduated from Yoncalla High School and a few years later married the girl next door, Opal Crow. Rudy and Opal shared a happy, lasting bond, celebrating their fifty-second anniversary this past summer. \r\nRudy and Opal moved to the Eugene area in 1961 where he attended the University of Oregon, graduating in 1965 and becoming a life-long Duck fan. While living in Eugene their two daughters, Kimberly and Kelly were born.\r\nAfter college Rudy worked fifteen years for Texaco, Inc. as an area representative. During that time he formed strong friendships and connections that helped guide him as he later developed his entrepreneurial  interests, becoming self-employed in 1980, eventually owning several stations and mini-markets.\r\nRudy loved country living and the family relocated to the Crow/Veneta area in 1970 where they lived until 1998. Rudy, a truly self-motivated, energetic man, took care of various interests while beginning his own business, Powell and Associates, doing land clearing, road building, selective logging, and property development. He and his long-time partner and friend started Allsup-Powell and developed several subdivisions and other projects. For Rudy, work was play and he greeted each new day with enthusiasm. He loved cars and equipment and felt a man should never be without a pickup or a tractor. He very much enjoyed his gold mine property in the Bohemia area. He made many good, new friends with each new pursuit.\r\n\tRudy had an active life made especially rich by four wonderful grandchildren. Rudy and Opal traveled and vacationed often, but time at home with his family was always most valued.\r\n\tRudy was preceded in death by his best friend and companion, his brother, \u201cReggie.\u201d He is survived by his wife, Opal, his daughters, Kelly Powell of Eugene, and Kimberly Gosser and son-in-law, Tim Gosser of Yakima, Washington, and grandchildren, Matt Gosser of Cheney, Washington, Carlie Ballinger and husband, Charlie Ballinger of Fort Belvoir, Virginia, and Katelyn Emmons and Kendyl Gosser of Yakima.\r\nA service is scheduled for 11:00am on January 2, 2013 at Springfield Memorial Funeral Home. The family wishes to thank the Willamette Valley Cancer Institute for their thoughtful care during Rudy\u2019s seven year battle with Multiple Myeloma, and Cascade Hospice for their valuable support. In lieu of flowers the family requests donations to the American Cancer Society.\r\n"
